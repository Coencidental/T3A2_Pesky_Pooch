## Application Description

### Purpose

The purpose of this web application is to act as a clear and concise platform for the client to promote their service/brand.

It will also act as a gateway of communication between the client and potentially interested customers through the ‘customer enquiry form’ feature of the website.

### Functionality / features

The functionality and features of the ‘Pesky Pooch’ web application was decided through the combination of user stories and clientele feedback. Such functionality/features that were implemented include:

- **‘Customer Enquiry Form’,** this is the most essential feature of the application, an input form to allow users to send customer enquiries. This form is attached to the clients email server where she will receive the enquiries in her inbox. In addition to using an Email API Service, we have also decided to save these 'customer enquiry forms' to our applications database, for archiving and recording purposes. Thus, ensuring the highest level of data security.

- **‘Testimonials Section’,** where users can input reviews for the ‘Pesky Pooch’ business. This feature includes live updating through the use of React. When users input a testimonial it is immediately available for display on the website. In addition to this, because ‘Pesky Pooch’ has accumulated a wealth of already existing testimonials to date. We will be including these already existing reviews into this features section via a web scraper Coen has built.

- **‘Events’ Section,** where our client can display past and upcoming events that she is either hosting or attending in the ‘dog community’. This section was inspired via the events section on our clients business’ facebook page. Coen has also confirmed that his/our client is heavily active in the dog community, therefore this section is important to our client and as a result, an important component in our application.

- **‘Operator Account’,** this account is intended for use by the operator (which is the website/business owner. I.e - our client). This feature was created with usability/UX in mind. The client can easily access the account by clicking on the copyright symbol in the websites footer. Once clicked, the client is redirected to a simple login form (thus eliminating the need for the client to memorize a specific URL). Here the client can login securely with ‘OAuth’ verification. Upon login, the client receives full CRUD capabilities to allow the deletion of testimonials/reviews.

- **Session management** for the ‘operator account’ (client stays logged in for a reasonable period of time after successful authentication).

### Target audience

The target audience intended for the ‘Pesky Pooch’ web application is effectively the clientele (or potential clientele) of the ‘Pesky Pooch’ business. This includes dog owners with dogs that may need treatment for problems such as: behavioural issues, problem barking and pet obedience.

### Tech stack :computer:

The following tech stack was used in the development of the ‘Pesky Pooch’ web application:

- MongoDB / Mongoose as a backend database.
- NodeJS as Javascript runtime environment.
- ExpressJS open source framework for creating the server application on NodeJS.
- ReactJS framework to handle page routing & page rendering.
- CypressJS for testing both front-end and back-end application code.
- HTML & CSS for front-end visual styling.
- Netlify platform for deploying / hosting the application.
